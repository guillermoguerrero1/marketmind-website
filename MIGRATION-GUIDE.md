   - `index.html`
   - `privacy-policy.html`
   - `support.html`
   - `css/styles.css`
   - Any image assets (create an `assets/` folder if missing)
   - Any JavaScript files (create a `js/` folder if missing)

## Step 2: Access HostGator cPanel
1. Log into your HostGator account
2. Access cPanel (usually found in your hosting dashboard)
3. Navigate to "File Manager" or "File Manager" section

## Step 3: Upload Your Website Files

## Step 4: Configure Domain Settings

2. **Check all pages** work correctly

## Step 6: SSL Certificate (HTTPS)

3. **Force HTTPS** using the .htaccess file (already included)

## Step 7: Performance Optimization
1. **Enable GZIP compression** (usually enabled by default)
